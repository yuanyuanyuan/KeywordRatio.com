### What Does KGR Mean for SEO

When it comes to SEO, pinpointing the optimal keywords is key. The **Keyword Golden Ratio (KGR)** is a vital SEO indicator that can uncover under-saturated keywords. This concept, introduced by Doug Cunnington of [Niche Site Project](https://nichesiteproject.com/), is designed to uncover keywords that have been ignored by competitors due to their low search volume.

#### Core Concept of KGR

At the heart of **KGR** is the balance between supply and demand. If the quantity of content ranking for a keyword on the Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) surpasses the number of searches for that keyword, then supply is outpacing demand. This is common with trending keywords. In contrast, the KGR approach targets keywords where the supply of content is less than or equal to the demand.

#### The Potential of Long-Tail Keywords

**KGR** often aligns with long-tail keywords, which are extended phrases typically comprising four or more words. Despite their lower search volumes, these keywords offer less competition, making them prime candidates for the KGR strategy.

#### How to Identify KGR Keywords

Identifying **KGR** keywords involves locating a keyword with a monthly search volume of 250 or fewer, and ensuring there are under 63 title results (as indicated by Google's advanced search operator `allintitle`). These metrics signal less competition and a higher chance of achieving a top ranking.

Focusing on **KGR** keywords allows websites to strategically enhance their SEO efforts, increase their search engine visibility, and consequently, draw in more organic traffic. In the subsequent sections, we will explore the process of calculating KGR, offering practical steps and examples to guide you in harnessing this potent SEO tool.


## How KGR Works

The **Keyword Golden Ratio (KGR)** operates on a simple yet potent principle. Here's how you can implement the KGR approach:

1. **Identify Relevant Keywords**: Start by pinpointing a keyword with a monthly search volume around 250 or less. These tend to be long-tail keywords that face less competition, potentially securing a higher placement on the Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs).

2. **Inspect Title Results**: Conduct a search using Google's advanced search operator `allintitle:` with your keyword to confirm that there are less than 63 title results. This threshold is crucial to the KGR strategy, as it indicates the current number of pages optimized for that keyword.

3. **Craft High-Quality Content**: After identifying a suitable KGR keyword, your team should craft and publish content that is both high-quality and keyword-rich. The content should not only feature the target keyword but also offer meaningful value to readers.

1. **Capitalize on Low Competition**: With the reduced competition for your targeted keyword, the content you produce is more likely to achieve a prominent ranking on the SERPs. This can lead to a swift surge in your organic traffic.


### KGR Calculation Formula

The formula for calculating KGR is straightforward and explicit:

$$ \text{KGR} = \frac{\text{Title Result Count}}{\text{Monthly Local Search Volume}} $$

`KGR = (Title Result Count / Monthly Local Search Volume)`

- **Title Result Count**: Refers to the total number of pages containing your keyword as determined by a Google search using the `allintitle:` operator.
- **Monthly Local Search Volume**: This is the frequency of searches for a particular keyword within a given timeframe, typically a month, and can be sourced from various third-party SEO utilities.

A lower KGR score indicates that there is less content available for that keyword, meaning your content has a higher probability of ranking higher on the SERPs in relation to the demand. The goal is to target keywords with a KGR score below 0.25.

![KGR means keyword golden ratio](https://mangools.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/keyword-golden-ratio-example.png)

This formula offers a definitive quantitative measure for SEO, assisting website proprietors and content creators in concentrating their efforts on keywords that are most likely to generate traffic.

In the subsequent section, we will delve into the metrics of KGR and learn how to leverage these metrics to refine your SEO tactics.


## KGR Metrics

The KGR metric serves as a pivotal measure for assessing the potential of keywords, factoring in both their search volume and the quantity of title results. Here are some key insights into KGR metrics:

### Monthly Search Volume

- **Approximately 250**: The ideal KGR keywords generally have a monthly search volume around 250 or fewer. There's some leeway in this figure, but ideally, it should not surpass 500 to keep the competition low.

### KGR Score

- **Less than 0.25**: A KGR score below 0.25 suggests that your keyword is highly likely to achieve a prominent ranking on search engines.
- **Between 0.25 and 1.00**: Scores in this range indicate a moderate probability of your keyword achieving a high ranking.
- **Above 1.00**: A KGR score exceeding 1.00 signifies a reduced likelihood of your keyword ranking prominently.

### KGR Calculation Example

Consider a keyword with 63 title results and a monthly search volume of 250. Using the KGR formula, we get:

$$ \text{KGR} = \frac{\text{Title Result Count}}{\text{Monthly Local Search Volume}} = \frac{63}{250} = 0.252 $$

Here, the KGR value of 0.252 is marginally above the optimal threshold of 0.25, yet it remains within an acceptable range. However, should the title result count rise while the monthly search volume stays constant, the KGR value will rise accordingly, diminishing the probability of your content achieving a high ranking.


### Note

- **Keyword Density**: When crafting content, ensure that keywords are seamlessly woven into the text, steering clear of keyword stuffing.
- **Content Quality**: High-quality content is essential for boosting SEO rankings. Your content should deliver value to your target audience.

Analyzing KGR metrics can help you uncover keywords that have the potential to drive organic traffic to your site. In the following section, we will discuss how to apply the KGR formula and offer practical examples for calculation.

## How to Calculate KGR Using the Formula

With a grasp of the KGR concept and its significance, let's proceed to understand how to apply the KGR formula to assess potential keywords. The KGR calculation hinges on two critical data points:

1. **Title Result Count with "allintitle" Keyword**: Obtained using Google's advanced search operator `allintitle:`, this figure represents the total number of web pages with the specified keyword in their title.

2. **Monthly Search Volume for the Keyword**: This indicates how frequently a keyword is searched within a given timeframe, typically a month. You can source this data from SEO tools like [Semrush](https://www.semrush.com/) and [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/), or you may export it directly.

### KGR Calculation Formula

The fundamental formula for KGR calculation is:

$$
\text{KGR} = \frac{\text{Title Result Count}}{\text{Monthly Local Search Volume}}
$$

### Steps for Calculation

1. **Identify the Keyword**: Select a keyword with potential based on your analysis.
2. **Search for Title Results**: Perform a search using `allintitle:Your Keyword` in Google and note the number of results.
3. **Acquire Search Volume Data**: Utilize SEO tools to determine the keyword's monthly search volume.
4. **Apply the Formula**: Divide the title result count by the search volume to calculate the KGR value.

### Example

Consider the keyword "keyword golden ratio calculator":

1. A search with `allintitle:keyword golden ratio calculator` returns 52 title results.
2. SEO tools reveal a monthly search volume of 250 for this keyword.
3. Using the KGR formula, the calculation is:

$$
\text{KGR} = \frac{52}{250} = 0.208
$$

The KGR value of 0.208 suggests low competition for this keyword, indicating a promising SEO opportunity.

### Note

- Ensure the keywords you target are relevant to your site's content and appeal to your intended audience.
- When calculating KGR, take into account the stability and any seasonal variations in search volume.

Employing this approach allows for a more precise identification and evaluation of SEO keywords, ultimately enhancing your website's visibility and ranking on search engines.


## How to Utilize the "allintitle:" Search Operator

### Understanding the "allintitle:" Search Operator
A critical component of the KGR approach, the "allintitle:" Google search operator is instrumental in identifying web pages with specific keywords in their titles. Given the significance of title tags in SEO and their weight in search engine algorithms, this operator can be particularly beneficial.

### Applying the "allintitle:" Search Operator
To apply this operator, type the following into the Google search bar:

`allintitle:Your Keyword`

For instance, if you're interested in content about "keyword golden ratio" and want to view pages with this phrase in the title, your search query would be:
`allintitle:keyword golden ratio`

### Comparative Analysis
To illustrate the impact of using the "allintitle:" operator, consider the difference in search outcomes when employing versus not employing this operator:

- **Without "allintitle:"** Results may include pages where the keyword appears in the body, URL, or meta tags.
- **With "allintitle:"** Results are narrowed to pages with the keyword in the title, often indicating a higher relevance to the search term.

![use “allintitle” search result example](https://s.keywordratio.com/whynotbetter/2024/04/46a36bb7e199562bcb141baf3e12f142.webp)

![do not use “allintitle” search result example](https://s.keywordratio.com/whynotbetter/2024/04/3744dfb6a933978af93401fee08220fb.webp)

### Considerations
- **Precision**: Utilizing "allintitle:" enhances search precision by concentrating on the webpage's title section.
- **Volatility**: Given that search algorithms and page rankings are subject to change, it's crucial to periodically review "allintitle:" search outcomes to gauge competitive landscapes.

Mastering the "allintitle:" search operator can significantly enhance your keyword research capabilities, enabling you to identify KGR keywords with less competition that are ripe for ranking improvement.

In the subsequent section, we will explore how to extract local monthly search volumes from SEO tools, a pivotal step in the KGR calculation process.

### Emphasizing Cross-Verification

Given that various tools might report slightly varying data, it's crucial to gather data from multiple sources and conduct cross-verification. This practice ensures a more precise estimation of search volumes, leading to more informed decision-making.

### Data Utilization Guidelines

- **Seasonal Fluctuations**: Be cautious of seasonal variations in keyword search volumes. It's important to filter out these fluctuations to get an accurate gauge of search trends.
- **Long-Term Trends**: Rather than focusing solely on immediate data, analyze extended trends to uncover keywords with consistent potential.

By leveraging these tools and adhering to these guidelines, you can more confidently evaluate keyword search volumes, thereby strengthening the foundation of your KGR calculations and SEO strategies.


### Applying KGR with the Example Keyword "Keyword Ratio"

To illustrate the practical use of KGR, let's calculate and analyze the keyword "keyword ratio" to see it in action.

#### Gathering Essential Data

Initially, we'll collect two critical pieces of information:

1. **Title Result Count**: A search using the Google operator `allintitle:keyword ratio` yields 1,960 pages with the keyword in the title.
2. **Monthly Search Volume**: Data from SEO tools like SEMrush or Ahrefs indicates the monthly search volume for "keyword ratio" ranges from 30 to 90. To simplify our calculation, we'll use the median value of 60.

![`allintitle:keyword ratio` result](https://s.keywordratio.com/whynotbetter/2024/04/96c4eda5055092a70c8c20c60041a8c9.webp)

#### Performing the KGR Calculation

We then apply the KGR formula as follows:

$$
\text{KGR} = \frac{\text{Number of Title Results}}{\text{Monthly Local Search Volume}} = \frac{1960}{60} \approx 32.67
$$

#### Interpreting the KGR Value

As previously mentioned, a KGR value below 0.25 suggests good potential for ranking. However, with a KGR value of 32.67, the keyword "keyword ratio" is significantly above the optimal threshold, indicating high competition.

#### Exploring Optimization Strategies

Even though the KGR value for "keyword ratio" is high, optimization opportunities still exist. Consider these approaches:

1. **Long-Tail Keywords**: Identify more extended, specific keywords associated with "keyword ratio" that may have lower KGR values and less competition.
2. **Content Enhancement**: Boost the page's authority and relevance by offering comprehensive analyses, case studies, or instructional content.
3. **Link Building**: Secure reputable external links to bolster the website's credibility and improve its ranking prospects.

By examining the KGR value and implementing these strategies, you can better position your content to compete in the search engine landscape.

#### The Keyword Difficulty (KD) Value Further Indicates Challenging Optimization
![keyword ratio 's KD is 18](https://s.keywordratio.com/whynotbetter/2024/04/ccee2c30b650958b85538ea0dd437a67.webp)
Furthermore, the Keyword Difficulty (KD) value for "keyword ratio" is 18, suggesting that achieving a prominent placement for this keyword presents a moderate challenge.


#### Additional Examples of Comparable KGR Keywords:

For the search term `allintitle:keywords golden ratio`, we get 338 results, with a monthly search volume that's below 250. The calculated KGR is 338 divided by 250, which equals 1.352. This is not ideal as it significantly exceeds the threshold of 0.25.

![Poor KGR Example for `allintitle:keywords golden ratio`](https://s.keywordratio.com/whynotbetter/2024/04/b2cc6deaf6c9473ca95b49d8354993f2.webp)

On the other hand, `allintitle:keyword golden ratio calculator` results in 52, and with a monthly search volume also below 250, the KGR comes to 52 divided by 250, which equals 0.208. This is favorable as it is less than 0.25.

![Good KGR Example for `allintitle:keywords golden ratio`](https://s.keywordratio.com/whynotbetter/2024/04/29229d0afb245d8fbe353cbdaf59bebd.webp)
